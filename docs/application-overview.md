The application is a bit hard to explain(I highly recommend playing with the app).

Users can play ready-made quizzes and win exciting prizes. There are two types of quizzes free and paid. for paid quizzes, user has to pay a certain amount of money in order to access those quizzes and the user can ask for a refund if the user wants. Users also can manage all of their paid quizzes.

The quiz itself has some distinct features.

Every Quiz has 2 types of timing: <br>
A. Per question-wise timing. <br>
B. Whole quiz-wise timing.<br>

For example, if the admin chooses question-based timing then he can set a fixed time for a question. All questions will have the same time. Timing will reset for every new question.

If the admin chooses the whole quiz-wise time then the timer will be based on the entire quiz.

If time is over the answer is auto-submitted

Admin can create quizzes(with distinct features that will be discussed later), manage quizzes, manage users, make a refund if he thinks user's refund application is valid and also can work with revenue data.

Quiz answers can be shown in 3 ways: <br>
A/ After Question.<br>
B/ After submission.<br>
C/ After all retakes. <br>

For 'after all retakes' types, users will have the choice to see the answers but their retakes will become zero and won't be able to play this quiz again.
